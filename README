To run on your machine:

1. Clone repo
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Open terminal in repo location and run 'npm run compile-css'

That will set up the files on your machine so you can take a look.
If you want to play around with the config options or add some of your own code, run 'npm run watch-css' and it will auto-compile your sass into css on save.
